# Codecademy-Store-Project

A Project in Codecademy about Redux.
In Redux you create an action creator for the cartSlice.js, also changeItemQuantity to add items and remove. Therefore you need an cartReducer to combine it later in the store.js.
Then you combine everything in a rootreducer, like inventoryReducer, cartReducer, currencyReducer and searchTermReducer in store.js.
Therefore in index.js its connecting Redux with the top-level React component (App).
All the presentational components being rendered in App.js.
